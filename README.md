Sunrise Laundry Services Website
 Project Overview
 
The Sunrise Laundry Services Website is a responsive, user-friendly website built to establish an online presence for Sunrise Laundry.
It provides customers with quick access to company information, services, pricing, and a convenient contact page with Google Maps integration.
This project is designed to showcase Sunrise Laundry’s services such as washing and folding, ironing, dry cleaning, pickup & delivery, and business laundry solutions.

The website includes the following pages:
•	Home – Welcome message and hero image
•	About Us – Company history, mission, and vision
•	Services – Detailed description of all services offered
•	Pricing – List of services and transparent pricing
•	Gallery – Sample images of services
•	Contact – Contact form and Google Map integration

•	Home Page – Hero section with welcome message and call-to-action
•	About Us Page – Information on company background, mission, and vision

 Image Responsiveness Update
All images now use percentage-based sizes instead of fixed pixel values.
For example:
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo" class="responsive-img">
With CSS:
.responsive-img {
    width: 50%;   /* or 100% depending on placement */
    height: auto; /* maintains aspect ratio */
    max-width: 300px; /* optional: prevents images from being too large */
}
This ensures the site looks great on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
 Technologies Used
•	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3
•	Editor: Visual Studio Code
•	Responsive Images: CSS percentage-based styling
